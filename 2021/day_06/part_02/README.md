# Part Two

Suppose the lanternfish live forever and have unlimited food and space. Would they take over the entire ocean?

After 256 days in the example above, there would be a total of 26984457539 lanternfish!

How many lanternfish would there be after 256 days?

**The solution for this, is the same as for part 01!**

Call it with

    php main.php [input] 256
